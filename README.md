# 1.	Overview of the analysis for PyBer company

<p align="justify"> The purpose of the analysis is determinate how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at the company (PyBer). First, it will be presented a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type; afterwards the results will be presented in a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# 2.	Results

<p align="justify"> As the first step in the process, it was necessary to merge two datasets known as, city data and ride data. This step allows to have full perspective of the data information and facilitates to create summaries. As the common variable among the datasets is city, it was decided to merge both datasets base on that variable as follows:

<p align="justify"> Afterwards it was possible to get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, this summary DataFrame show the final results.

-	Total rides and drivers, 68% (1,625 rides) per cent of the total rides are performed in urban areas, followed by suburban with 26% (625) and rural areas with 5% (125). It is possible to say that the demand for this service is mainly in cities. The total drivers performed in the same trend, 81% (2,405) are in urban areas, 16% (490) in suburban areas and 3% (78) in rural areas. 

-	Total fares, in terms of total revenues collected from the service. The 63% ($39,854) come from urban areas, 30% ($19,356) and 7% ($4,328) from rural areas. 

-	Average fare per ride and driver, the lowest average fare per ride is in urban areas $24.53 per ride, followed by suburban areas $30.97 per ride and $34.62 per ride. The same trend is observed in the average fare per driver; the lowest is performed by urban areas $16.57, followed by suburban areas $39.50 and the highest is rural areas $55.49. 

<p align="justify"> This summary reflects an interesting principle of the taxi and/or driving business and as well as from the principle of the economy itself. 

<p align="justify"> First all, it is well known that the taxi and/or business is more profitable when larger distances are travel, this principle is because of the behavior of the unit cost. When comparing operating yields or unit cost between routes one should always bear in mind how these values vary with distance performed. The unit costs drop quite rapidly with increasing stage length in the short-/medium-haul range, whereas it has a very gentle decrease with increasing stage length in the long-haul range. The operating yield curve behaves in the same manner. 

<p align="justify"> However, after the analysis of the average fare per ride and driver it seems to be that PyBer business does not follow the principle of a regular taxi or driving business.  Seems to be that PyBer business follows the principle of the demand law, that says:

      ***“The law of demand states that the quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded”.***

<p align="justify"> This statement is clearly reflected in the behavior of the average fare per ride and per driver. PyBer services are more demanded in the urban areas, therefore the average fares are significantly lower that the ones in rural areas where the demand of PyBer services is less. This makes sense due to, in urban areas the population density is higher than in suburban and rural areas, as well as it is possible to think that urban areas have more options to transportation than suburban and rural areas, therefore PyBer needs to be more competitive providing better fares per kilometer performed. 

<p align="justify"> Finally, the multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city.

<p align="justify"> The graph reinforces the beforemention statement where the collection of fares in urban areas is significantly higher than in suburban and rural areas.

# 3.	Summary

<p align="justify"> After the analysis it is possible to make three suggestions to the CEO. 

-	As urban services might be considering as the cow product (service), it is suggested to increase the user experience, as comfort, less time of waiting, sense of safety and security. 

-	Rural services might be a good business option, by proving flexibility in the service as well as reducing the fare by market strategies such as “sharing the ride” with friends, acquaintance and/or colleagues. Also, it might be possible to make more flexible the booking considering the larger distances to travel, which in terms of unit cost principal might be beneficial for the company. 

-	It is suggested to analyze the business performance taking more variables like cost and unit cost and the passenger yield is obtained by dividing the passenger revenues by the corresponding passenger-kilometres performed, this kind of analysis might to the company to have more comprehensive analysis.
